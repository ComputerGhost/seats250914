# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #2

This is the **June 8, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

## Status

The development schedule plans for the "visual draft" to be completed by June 8. This step involves uploading a visual draft of the public website and content management system (CMS) for review. It is not required for the website to be fully functional, but all webpages must be accessible for reviewing.

[TBD - confirm this is correct on June 8]  On June 8, the "visual draft" was completed. A visual draft of the public website and CMS were uploaded. Additionally, tests, which are documented in the code repository](https://github.com/ComputerGhost/seats250914/tree/main/tests) but are omitted here for brevity, were performed to ensure no issues were introduced. The website is now ready for a visual review.

## Concerns

Detailed reviews of the "privacy policy" and "terms of service" are imperative for legal reasons. For the former, it is important that it follows all applicable laws for websites that collect personally identified information like ours does. For the later, it is important that it is accurate to what we intend.

Last week's concern of the latency in South Korea has not yet been addressed. GitHub issue [#19](https://github.com/ComputerGhost/seats250914/issues/19) has been created to address it, so hopefully it will be addressed soon. Nathan is responsible for addressing this issue.

## Next Steps

The next week of development, ending on June 15, is planned to yield a "complete CMS". Our staff will be able to log in and manage the website--at least in theory, because the public website will not yet be feature-complete.
