# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #2

This is the **June 8, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

## Status

The development schedule plans for the "visual draft" to be completed by June 8. This step involves uploading a visual draft of the public website and content management system (CMS) for review. It is not required for the website to be fully functional, but all webpages must be accessible for reviewing.

On June 8, the "visual draft" was completed. A visual draft of the public website and CMS were uploaded. Additionally, tests, which are documented in the code repository](https://github.com/ComputerGhost/seats250914/tree/main/tests) but are omitted here for brevity, were performed to ensure no issues were introduced. The website is now ready for a visual review.

## Concerns

Detailed reviews of the "privacy policy" and "terms of service" are imperative for legal reasons. For the former, it is important that it follows all applicable laws for websites that collect personally identified information like ours does. For the later, it is important that it is accurate to what we intend.

What are the licenses of the resources that we receive from designers and others? We need to know exactly how we can use the material before we use it.

Last week's concern of the latency in South Korea has not yet been addressed. GitHub issue [#19](https://github.com/ComputerGhost/seats250914/issues/19) has been created to address it, so hopefully it will be addressed soon. Nathan is responsible for addressing this issue.

I used some uncommon methods to render the map and ticket widgets in the way I wanted, so I'm worried about their compatibility across devices. I provided fallback solutions if they break, but I'd prefer they not break in the first place. This will need some extra testing.


## Next Steps

Next week, ending on June 15:
 1. Developers need to translate and make functional the Content Management System (CMS).
 1. Reviewers need to review the visuals of the public website and the CMS. Please be critical and detailed.

The changes from the reviews will not come due until July 7. They may be completed sooner if development time permits, but such changes will not be published until a planned deployment date (which is every weekend).

Please submit change requests from the reviewing process to Nathan. Here are the current items in todo:

 * The top bar blends into some sections, so a border or shadow needs added.
 * The top bar's active item doesn't work perfectly when scrolling up and down a lot.
 * The website doesn't load fast enough for Nathan's satisfaction.
 * Translations (These will be done week #3 for the CMS and week #4 for the public website.)
 * Add functionality (This will be done week #3 for the CMS and week #4 for the public website.)
 * [Various technical unseen changes.]


## Unreachable URLs

Because the website is currently visual and (mostly) not functional, there are some webpages that currently can only be accessed directly:

 * https://hyelinfanmeeting2025.com/reservation/new
 * https://hyelinfanmeeting2025.com/reservation/payment
 * https://cms.hyelinfanmeeting2025.com/accounts/sign-in
 * https://cms.hyelinfanmeeting2025.com/accounts/sign-out

Additionally, there are some error webpages that normally cannot be viewed unless something has gone wrong. These webpages can be viewed without a bad state at the URLs below. Some of them should be visibly the same but are technically different, which is why there may appear to be duplicate entries.

 * https://hyelinfanmeeting2025.com/error
 * https://hyelinfanmeeting2025.com/error/0
 * https://hyelinfanmeeting2025.com/error/404
 * https://hyelinfanmeeting2025.com/error/500
 * https://cms.hyelinfanmeeting2025.com/error
