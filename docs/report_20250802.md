# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #10

This is the **August 2, 2025** and final progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

## Status

Everything is complete. Everything has been tested thoroughly. Monitors have been installed and notify Nathan of any downtime. Everything has been published and configured. We are ready to go live.

## Next steps

Nathan will watch the logs closely for the first four days for any problems.

On August 11, our server provider planned maintenance that may restart our websites. Nathan will monitor this closely to resolve any resulting issues quickly.

## Future updates

No updates are planned, but if any are necessary, they can be applied on Sunday nights (CST) after at least a two day notification.

No off-cycle updates can be made unless absolutely necessary, because rushing the testing and release processes is risky.
