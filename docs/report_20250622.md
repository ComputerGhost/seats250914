# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #4

This is the **June 22, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

## Status

By this date, the development schedule planned for the public website to be fully functional. Following last week, the entire project is scheduled to be fully functional now.

And we reached the progress goals. The public website is fully functional, and it ties nicely to the CMS for a complete seat reservation system.

## Not completed

A disclaimer was added before the "Reserve seat" button near the end of the week. There was not time to translate it.

## Next Steps

The next week's development work will end on June 29. The goal for the week is to add real-time updates to the seat map. (This will be really cool.)

If development time permits, other requested and needed changes will be worked on this week too.

Please continue to review the CMS and public websites, and submit any change requests to Nathan. (The current list of changes to be done is on GitHub but is omitted here for brevity.)


## Attachments

The new functionality of the public website responding to the reservation schedule is tedious to test, so a screenshot demonstrating it is provided as an attachment.
