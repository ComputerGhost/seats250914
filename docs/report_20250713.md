# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #8

This is the **July 13, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

Details of updates are omitted here, but they are fully logged in the GitHub repository.

## Status

We have several ongoing efforts.

### Status: "Original Scope of Work: Completion"

Except for the Korean translations, the original scope of work for the project is now completed. The Korean translations will be moved to the "Additional translations" effort.

### Status: "Additional translations"

This effort is beginning now. In the next week, we hope to translate the public website into Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese. And we hope to finish the Korean translations.

### Status: "Multiple seat selection"

This effort is beginning now. In the next two weeks, development work will focus on adding the ability for fans to reserve more than one seat at a time.

The website release date is the 20st, and this will not be finished by that date. However, it will be finished and deployed by the ticketting open date of August 4.

### Status: "Additional changes"

These items are out of scope of other efforts and low-priority. They will be completed when time permits:

 * Create a website monitor
 * Improve email processor code quality -- it was necessarily thrown together quickly

These items of the same category were completed (ahead of schedule) since the last update:

 * Add staging websites so that we can test updates separately from the production websites.
	* URL: https://staging.hyelinfanmeeting2025.com
	* URL: https://staging-cms.hyelinfanmeeting2025.com
 * Add green-blue deployment so that we can deploy updates with near zero downtime.

## Needed information

Nathan will provide documents needing translated into various other languages. These need returned by July 19 at the latest.

## Next steps

The focus for this coming week will be on multiple seat selection and translations. It is unlikely that there will be bandwidth for anything more until late in the following week.

The next release date is Saturday, July 19th. If we must postpone this, then the following day is also acceptable.
