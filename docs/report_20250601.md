# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #1

This is the **June 1, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

## Status

The development schedule plans for the "rough sketch" to be completed by June 1. This step involves uploading a basic website to test basic technologies that will be used to serve the website to users. Any hosting or other major technical problems are identified and resolved early at this step.

On May 31, the "rough sketch" step was completed. A basic website with our required features was created, published, and tested. The tests are [documented in the code repository](https://github.com/ComputerGhost/seats250914/tree/main/tests) but are omitted here for brevity. We are currently on schedule.

Costs amounting to **$20 USD** were accumulated this week. This is less than the estimate because a free certificate was used for the SSL certificate. Only the domain name required a purchase.


## Concerns

A higher-than-desired latency was observed when connecting over a VPN in South Korea. The website loaded after 2.1 seconds. Compare that to 0.04 seconds when connecting from Mississippi. GitHub issue [#19](https://github.com/ComputerGhost/seats250914/issues/19) has been created to address this issue.

## Next Steps

The next week of development, ending on June 8, is planned to yield a "visual draft". The CMS and public website will be available to collect feedback over the following week.
