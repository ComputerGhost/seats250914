# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #9

This is the **July 20, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

Details of updates are omitted here, but they are fully logged in the GitHub repository.

## Status

We have several ongoing efforts.

### Status: "Additional translations"

The translation effort is complete.  The website is now available in Chinese (Simplified), English, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese.

### Status: "Multiple seat selection"

The two-week multiple seat selection effort was started one week ago. It is progressing exactly as scheduled.

In this first week, multiple seat selection was fully implemented. Staff can play around with the feature on Staging.

In the upcoming week, work will focus on improving quality, building automated tests and doing manual tests, and fixing seat selection and display bugs.

### Status: "Additional changes"

There is some work that does not fit into the scope of a defined effort.

Since the last update, one of these items was completed: A website monitor was set up through <https://uptimerobot.com> under their free plan. This notifies Nathan via Email if our website goes offline.

There remains one more out of defined scope item to do: The email processor code quality needs to be improved. We may not have time for this. As long as it continues to work, it may be left at sub-par quality.

## Next steps

Please set up the VIP seats for the website before the ticketing opens on August 4.

The next website release date is Saturday, July 26. This will also be the final release date unless a correction needs to be made to the website.
