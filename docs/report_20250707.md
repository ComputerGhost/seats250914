# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #7

This is the **July 7, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

## Status: "Final draft"

The development schedule plans for the "final draft" development to start on June 30 and end on July 6. The goal is for the developer to complete all of the requested changes to the content and existing functionality. This yields a product that can be reviewed for any functional tweaks or content changes--not for feature changes.

The revised development schedule does not alter the dates of this coding sprint, but it does add a progress report in the middle. Per the last progress report on July 2, some items were yet to be completed.

All of the items within the original scope are now completed, and this sprint is done.


## Status: "Stress tests"

The original development schedule plans for the "stress tests" sprint to start on July 7 and end on July 13. This would stress and test the website very thoroughly. Any problems uncovered would be resolved.

The revised development schedule moved the dates of this sprint to July 4 through July 10. These dates overlap with its predecessor and successor.

### Current progress

The website now has 281 automated tests. These test individual components, components together, and full user flows through the website. These tests are run against the websites in various configurations and states.

During the tests, a handful of obscure bugs have been discovered and fixed.

Because of these tests, we can feel confident about the website working when we go live.

### Not yet completed

Most of the testing has been completed, but there are a few more tests that need done:

- Test the websites on all major browsers.
- Test the public website on browsers as old as ten years old.
- Test the websites with common browser plugins that may interfere with the functionality.
- Test the websites with JavaScript disabled.
- Do more testing of website speed globally.


## Next steps

Until July 10, development work will focus concurrently focus on the "stress test" and "completion" sprints. From July 11 through July 13, development work will focus on the "completion" sprint.

The "completion" sprint will finalize any functional tweaks or content changes. An update will be given halfway through on July 10.

The "completion" sprint also involves configuring the website to go live. This will be done near the end of the sprint.


## Next next steps

After the website is "completed", it is still not safe to announce its URL. While we have moved the completion date up to accommodate additional changes, the safe "go-live" date must remain set at July 20.

The server needs to be configured for staging websites. This is not a quick thing to do, so it will be delayed until closer to the original July 20 deadline.

The staging websites will allow us to demonstrate and test any changes freely before pushing the updates to the public. There will be some down time for the public, typically around 15 minutes. (Nathan knows how to reduce it to 0 but would need convincing to set that up.)
