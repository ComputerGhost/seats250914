# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #6

This is the **July 2, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

## Status

By this date, the development schedule planned for completing all of the requested changes to the content and existing functionality.

Many bugs were fixed, things were tweaked, and pieces of content were translated. The full records of these changes are maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/ComputerGhost/seats250914/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), but they are omitted here for brevity.

## Not yet completed

There are some changes (within the original project scope) that still need done:

1. (Enhancement) CMS - Create a good dashboard.
1. (Enhancement) Public - Improve titlebar text to be more descriptive.
1. (Enhancement) Public - Speed up the website in key locations.*
1. (Bug) CMS - When there are no reservations, the reservation index shows a related message in English.
1. (Translation) Public - Translate the legal documents.

## Next steps

Over the next few days, Nathan will focus on thoroughly testing the website to make sure that all of the parts work well. Simultaneously, the dashboard will be worked on by both developers with a hopeful release date on July 6.

There are some tasks for the non-developers of the team to do too:

 1. Review the English legal document and submit any changes ASAP.
 1. Let me know what form fields are needed for the reservations ASAP.
 1. Provide the final text content in both English and Korean ASAP.

Please provide the content changes as soon as possible (ASAP) so that they can be translated over the weekend. Or, provide the content changes in both languages by July 5.

## Out of scope additions

There are two out-of-scope additions: a website monitor, and the ability to select multiple seats per reservation. The website monitor can be completed quickly, in a day or two. The multiple seats selection will require a couple of weeks.

The out of scope items will be started after the current scope of work is completed on July 13.

Though the total work will exceed the July 20 completion date communicated in May, it is not a blocker to going live on that date, because none of the parts to be changed will be visible to users until reservations open in August.
