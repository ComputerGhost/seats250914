# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #5

This is the **June 29, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

## Status

By this date, the development schedule planned for the seating widget to update in real time as visitors reserved seats. If Alice is looking at the seat map, then she will see Bob's seat disappear from her options as soon as he selects it. The updates happen live, and a page reload is not necessary.

This scheduled functionality was completed this week with time to spare.

## Additional progress

Spare time this week was used to get ahead of next week's tasks.

## Next week's steps

The next week's development work will end on June 6. The plan is to make all of the requested changes to the content and implement any desired changes to existing functionality.

The following week's scheduled work, which involves thorough testing, may be worked too this week, in parallel, to move the completion date sooner. This and other schedule changes are still being considered as of today.
