# Hyelin Fanmeeting 2025 Progress Report #2

This is the **June 15, 2025** progress update for the development of the ticketing website.

## Status

By this date, the development schedule planned for the CMS to be functional while the public website remains in its "visual draft".

The goal for this week was reached. The CMS is functional. It obviously needs a few more changes and features to be nicer to work with, but it will already do the job that it is designed to do.

The sign-in procedure to test the newest CMS update will be communicated separately.

## Concerns

Technical concerns and issues are being tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/ComputerGhost/seats250914/issues), but they are omitted here for brevity. As needed, non-developers will be involved to resolve them.

Detailed reviews of the "privacy policy" and "terms of service" are imperative for legal reasons. For the former, it is important that it follows all applicable laws for websites that collect personally identified information like ours does. For the later, it is important that it is accurate to what we intend. These documents will need careful review.

What are the licenses of the resources that we receive from designers and others? We need to know exactly how we can use the material before we use it.


## Next Steps

The next week's development work will end on June 22. The goal is to make the public website fully functional.

If development time permits, requested visual changes to the public website will also be worked on this week.

Please continue to review the CMS and public websites, and submit any change requests to Nathan. (The current list of changes to be done is on GitHub but is omitted here for brevity.)
